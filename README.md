Hi out there! I´m @jmosta, retired professor and researcher in electrochemistry for 30 years (see https://bit.ly/31XG6zX).

During my career, I´ve been involved in programming for ad-hoc electrochemical instrumentation solutions, data analysis, and mathematical modeling.
Extracting information about natural processes from electrical or spectral data has occupied a great deal of my career, and now I'm looking forward to perform data analysis from a broader perspective using data science tools. 

I've just finished the "Data Science and Machine Learning: Making Data-Driven Decisions" course given by MIT-DSML and looking forward to continuing to gain experience in the use of the various mathematical tools and criteria available to extract useful information from unstructured data.

I'm reachable by email (jmosta at usb dot ve)
